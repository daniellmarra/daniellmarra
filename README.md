## Hello there   

My name is Daniel and I am 18 years old. I'm a beginner in web development.
When I graduated from high school, I was confused about which career to pursue, and as soon as I saw videos about programming and web development, the way the developers talked and helped each other and demonstrated how much they like what they do, I was delighted.

Since then, I study web development in a self-taught way, in search of becoming a developer too. I never really thought about technology, how exciting and fun it is. Was it love at first sight, does it sound a little clich√©? Yes haha, but it's a fact
